I"f<p>This is a blog for docing my working experience on python interacting with q.</p>

<p>The blog is realized using a normal git-page method but structed like gitbook, since online publishing and search engine are both required.</p>

<p>The gitbook template is modified from <a href="https://github.com/sighingnow/jekyll-gitbook">He Taoâ€™s project</a>.</p>
